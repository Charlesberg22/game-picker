# gamepicker
dockerised webapp to imitate my games spreadsheet

using a sqlite3 database, have a list of the games I have played/plan to play
Including a page for the play history, a randomiser that uses the retro/handheld tags to approach the same ratio of each in the played vs to-be-played lists
eventually make it pretty with game cover art
